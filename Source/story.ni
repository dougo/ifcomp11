"Last Day of Summer" by Cameron Fox.

Part - Notes

[
Specification (from Zarf):

* Game D: (Sunny town. Also a building site, with building stones piled around.)

You find a rusty knife, which you use to cut some stuff. You also come across a sundial, and (in the spirit of Trinity) unscrew the gnomon -- it's a repurposed brass key which you need. You then meet a man who wants the knife. In return, he gives you his hat, which you need to disguise your face for some reason or other.

Somewhere in this town, you come across a legend: a man who has stolen the treasure of time. Even worse, he then lost it. He is cursed to wander until he finds it again, and replaces it on the altar he stole it from.

So maybe just add a legend, or a legend element, that the treasure was split into two pieces which must be reunited?

The rusty knife in game D is the magic knife in game C.
If you unscrew the sundial gnomon and stick the knife in it, the shadow
points at a specific time.  The magic time is 9:37.

The hat has no specific physical description, but the protagonist in game D finds it surprising.
The man is also vaguely described, but is unshaven.

Part - The Story

When play begins:
	say "Today started out so well.  Up with the sun, you went out to the bog, filled a big basket with cranberries, and started for town.  Your dad had brought you along many times before on his trips to the greengrocer to sell his harvest, but you're old enough now to go by yourself.  Your parents will be so proud when you return to the hut with a pocket full of money!

You made your way through the fields on the outskirts of town, a cool but gentle breeze blowing through your hair.  The cloudless sky showed no sign of the huge storm that passed through a few days ago, but when you got to the river you found the mark it left: the splintered remains of the wooden bridge that the flood swept away.  Great, now how are you going to cross the river to get into town?

It's the last day of summer, and the sun shines bright and beautiful.  No sense in turning back so soon."

The time of day is 10:00 AM.

Section - The Rusty Knife

Before going to the scrub for the first time, say "You walk a ways upstream, until the scrub is too dense to go any further."

Before going to the mooring for the first time, say "You walk a ways downstream, until you come upon a welcome sight: a fishing boat, still tied securely to the near bank."

A fishing boat is a fixed in place enterable container in the mooring.  The description is "The boat is tied to a metal pole embedded in the near bank."

[Prefer using the knife, when guessing the second noun:]
Understand "cut [something] with [the knife]" as cutting it with.
Understand "cut [the boat] loose with [the knife]" as cutting it with.

First instead of cutting the boat with something: try cutting the rope with the second noun.
Instead of cutting with when the second noun is not the knife, say "[The second noun] is not sharp enough to cut [the noun]."
Instead of cutting someone with the knife, say "You wouldn't want to hurt [the noun]."
Instead of cutting something with the knife, say "You wouldn't want to damage [the noun]."

Instead of cutting the rope with the knife when the actor is not in the boat, say "[one of]You start cutting the rope, and find that the knife is indeed sharp enough.  But if you cut the rope and you're not in the boat, then the boat will float away without you![or]You're still not in the boat.[stopping]".
Instead of cutting the rope with the knife when the actor is in the boat and the cranberries are not enclosed by the boat, say "Wait, you can't go to town without the cranberries!"
Instead of cutting the rope with the knife:
	say "It takes a while, but you eventually manage to cut through the rope.  You shove off, and the boat quickly floats across the river.  You clamber up the far bank and set off once again for town.  Whew!

The rest of the trip into town is uneventful.  When you get to town, you head straight for the market."; [TO DO: wait for a key and clear the screen?]
	move the cranberries to the basket;
	move the basket to the player;
	increase the time of day by one hour;
	move the player to the market.	 

Check cutting with: instead say "This rule shouldn't be applied!  Please report this bug."

Chapter - The Market

The Market is a room.  "[if unvisited]Oh no!  The greengrocer is nowhere to be found.[end if]"

Chapter - Sunny Town

The Town Square is north of the Market.  Northeast is the Chapel.  Northwest is the Building Site.

"A grassy square marks the center of town, with streets leading out in the four cardinal directions.  The old chapel is on the northeast corner.  The northwest corner is a dusty building site, with stones lying around in piles.  The market is back south."

The grass is scenery in the square.  [TO DO: more scenery?  Something to do here?]
[TO DO: other streets]

The old chapel is scenery in the square.  "A rickety wooden chapel that was once painted white."  [TO DO: put this in the room description]
Instead of entering the old chapel, try going northeast.

Chapter - The Building Site

The Building Site is a room.  "Large building stones are piled around."
[TO DO: Why no exits?]

A pile of building stones is scenery in the building site.

Section - The Man in the Hat

[TO DO: no reason for him to be old now.]

The traveler is a privately-named man.  ["An old man sits on a bench.  A hat shades his eyes from the sun."]

Understand "man" as the traveler.  The printed name of the traveler is "man".

The traveler is on the pile of building stones.

The traveler wears a hat.
[TO DO: the hat is "surprising"...?]

[TO DO: gravestone?]

The traveler wants the knife.
[TO DO: indicate to the player that he wants the knife]

The player wants the hat.
After reporting giving the knife to the traveler:
	try the traveler giving the hat to the actor.

After reporting the traveler giving the hat to the player:
	say "Surprisingly, without his hat, the man doesn't look old at all: his face, though unshaven, is smooth and unwrinkled, and his eyes are sharp and clear.  With a crooked grin, he gives a little salute and wanders off.";
	now the traveler is off-stage.

Chapter - The Chapel

On some pews is a man called the greengrocer.  The pews are enterable in the chapel.  An altar is a supporter in the chapel.

[TO DO: legend of man who stole time]

Chapter - The Garden

The Garden is north of the chapel. "An overgrown garden with a sundial."

Section - The Sundial

The sundial is scenery in the garden.  "The sundial has markings carved around its top edge to allow the time to be indicated to the nearest minute."
Understand "time" as the sundial. [TO DO: this is so e.g. 'check time' works, but 'get time' shouldn't try to lift the sundial!]

The markings are a privately-named part of the sundial.
The description of the markings is "[if anything is in the sundial][A gnomon] protrudes from the center of the sundial at an angle, casting a shadow pointing to [the sundial time].[otherwise]There's nothing to cast a shadow onto the markings, making it pretty useless as a sundial."
Understand "markings" as the markings when we have examined the sundial.
Understand "shadow" as the markings when we have examined the sundial and anything is in the sundial.

To say a gnomon: say "[contents of the sundial]" in sentence case.
To say the sundial time: say "[if the knife is in the sundial]9:37 am[else][the time of day]".

[Custom printing of the sundial contents:]
Instead of examining the sundial:
	say "[the description of the noun][paragraph break][the description of the markings][line break]";
	rule succeeds. [So that "we have examined the sundial" will be true.]

[TO DO: sun is scenery]

[TO DO: end the game before the sun sets. "Time to get home now!"]

The brass key is a privately-named thing in the sundial.
The printed name of the key is "slender brass rod".
Understand "slender/brass/rod" as the key when the key is mentioned.
Understand "gnomon" as the key when the key is mentioned and the key is in the sundial.

Instead of taking the sundial, say "[The sundial] is far too heavy to lift."

Instead of turning or pulling the key when the key is in the sundial, try taking the key.

[From the "Removal" example:]
The taking action has an object called previous locale (matched as "from"). 
Setting action variables for taking: now previous locale is the holder of the noun.

After taking the key from the sundial:
	say "You twist [the key] and remove it from [the sundial].[no line break]";
	if the key is handled:
		say line break;
	otherwise:
		say "[paragraph break]Huh, look at that[--]it's actually a key!";
		now the printed name of the key is "brass key";
		now the description of the key is "A slender brass rod with key-teeth on one end."

Understand "key" as the key when the key is handled.

A thing can be gnomon-shaped.
Instead of inserting a thing into the sundial when the noun is not gnomon-shaped:
	say "It doesn't seem to fit."

The key and the knife are gnomon-shaped.
After inserting the key into the sundial:
	say "You screw [the key] back into [the sundial]."
After inserting the knife into the sundial:
	say "You jam [the knife] into [the sundial].  Strangely, the direction of its shadow seems to have nothing to do with the position of the sun..."

Understand the command "screw" as something new.
Understand "screw [something] into [something]" and "jam [something] into [something]" as inserting it into.

Instead of inserting something into the sundial when the sundial contains something:
	say "It doesn't seem to fit."


Section - The Bird

Instead of going north from the garden when the hat is not worn:
	say "[one of]You head towards the garden house, but a bird swoops down from its nest in the eaves of the garden house and attacks your hair!  You wave your arms to shoo it away, but it doesn't go away until you scurry back into the garden[or]The bird attacks you again.  No way you're getting into that garden house[stopping]."

[TO DO: bird, nest, eaves are scenery] 


Chapter - The Garden House

The Garden House is north of the garden.
A desk is a supporter in the garden house.
The drawer is part of the desk.
The drawer is closed and locked.
The key unlocks the drawer.
In the drawer is a book.

Before opening the drawer when the drawer is locked and the key is held:
	try unlocking the drawer with the key.

The greengrocer wants the book.

After reporting giving the book to the greengrocer:
	say "The greengrocer thanks you and rewards you handsomely.  You return home with the money for your family.";
	end the story finally.
