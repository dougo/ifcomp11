Part - Notes

[
Specification (from Zarf):

* Game D: (Sunny town. Also a building site, with building stones piled around.)

You find a rusty knife, which you use to cut some stuff. You also come across a sundial, and (in the spirit of Trinity) unscrew the gnomon -- it's a repurposed brass key which you need. You then meet a man who wants the knife. In return, he gives you his hat, which you need to disguise your face for some reason or other.

Somewhere in this town, you come across a legend: a man who has stolen the treasure of time. Even worse, he then lost it. He is cursed to wander until he finds it again, and replaces it on the altar he stole it from.

So maybe just add a legend, or a legend element, that the treasure was split into two pieces which must be reunited?

The rusty knife in game D is the magic knife in game C.
If you unscrew the sundial gnomon and stick the knife in it, the shadow
points at a specific time.  The magic time is 9:37.

The hat has no specific physical description, but the protagonist in game D finds it surprising.
The man is also vaguely described, but is unshaven.

Part - Rules and Relations

[TO DO: this is probably unnecessary.  Just do everything in after rules.]
The after reporting rules is a rulebook.

A specific action-processing rule (this is the after report stage rule):
	if action in world is true, abide by the after reporting rules.

Wanting relates a person to various things.  The verb to want (he wants, they want, he wanted, it is wanted, he is wanting) implies the wanting relation.

The block giving rule is not listed in the check giving it to rules.
Instead of giving something to someone when the second noun does not want the noun:
	say "[The second noun] doesn't want [the noun]."

[TO DO: handle exiting, or say something better than this:
>out
[You're not inside something. To leave this location, try a direction or "out".]
]

Part - The Story

Chapter - The Boy

The player carries a basket.  In the basket are some cranberries.

When play begins:
	say "You're off to the greengrocer's in town to sell a basket of cranberries from your family's bog."

Chapter - The Rusty Knife

The player carries a rusty knife.  The description of the knife is "Rust covers the blade of the knife, which ends in a tattered leather hilt."

[TO DO: find the knife somewhere else, cut something with it]

Chapter - The Market

The Market is a room.  "[if unvisited]Oh no!  The greengrocer is nowhere to be found.[end if]"

Chapter - Sunny Town

The Town Square is north of the Market.  Northeast is the Chapel.  Northwest is the Building Site.

"A grassy square marks the center of town, with streets leading out in the four cardinal directions.  The old chapel is on the northeast corner.  The northwest corner is a dusty building site, with stones lying around in piles.  The market is back south."

The grass is scenery in the square.  [TO DO: more scenery?  Something to do here?]

The old chapel is scenery in the square.  "A rickety wooden chapel that was once painted white."  [TO DO: put this in the room desc]
Instead of entering the old chapel, try going northeast.

Chapter - The Building Site

The Building Site is a room.  "Large building stones are piled around."
[TO DO: something to do here?  Why no exits?]

Chapter - The Chapel

On some pews is a man called the greengrocer.  The pews are enterable in the chapel.  An altar is a supporter in the chapel.

[TO DO: legend of man who stole time]

Chapter - The Garden

The Garden is north of the chapel. "An overgrown garden with a sundial."

Section - The Sundial

The sundial is scenery in the garden.  The description of the sundial is "The sundial is a flat circular slab of granite.  Markings carved around its top edge allow the time to be indicated to the nearest minute."
Understand "time" as the sundial. [TO DO: this is so e.g. 'check time' works, but 'get time' shouldn't try to lift the sundial!]
Understand "slab/granite" as the sundial when we have examined the sundial.

The markings are a privately-named part of the sundial.
The description of the markings is "[if anything is in the sundial][A gnomon] protrudes from the center of the sundial at an angle, casting a shadow pointing to [the sundial time].[otherwise]There's nothing to cast a shadow onto the markings, making it pretty useless as a sundial."
Understand "markings" as the markings when we have examined the sundial.
Understand "shadow" as the markings when we have examined the sundial and anything is in the sundial.

To say a gnomon: say "[contents of the sundial]" in sentence case.
To say the sundial time: say "[if the knife is in the sundial]9:37 am[else][the time of day]".

[Custom printing of the sundial contents:]
Instead of examining the sundial:
	say "[the description of the noun][paragraph break][the description of the markings][line break]";
	rule succeeds. [So that "we have examined the sundial" will be true.]

[TO DO: sun is scenery]

[TO DO: end the game before the sun sets. "Time to get home now!"]

The brass key is a privately-named thing in the sundial.
The printed name of the key is "slender brass rod".
Understand "slender/brass/rod" as the key when the key is mentioned.
Understand "gnomon" as the key when the key is mentioned and the key is in the sundial.

Instead of taking the sundial, say "[The sundial] is far too heavy to lift."

Instead of turning or pulling the key when the key is in the sundial, try taking the key.

[From the "Removal" example:]
The taking action has an object called previous locale (matched as "from"). 
Setting action variables for taking: now previous locale is the holder of the noun.

After taking the key from the sundial:
	say "You twist [the key] and remove it from [the sundial].[no line break]";
	if the key is handled:
		say line break;
	otherwise:
		say "[paragraph break]Huh, look at that[--]it's actually a key!";
		now the printed name of the key is "brass key";
		now the description of the key is "A slender brass rod with key-teeth on one end."

Understand "key" as the key when the key is handled.

A thing can be gnomon-shaped.
Instead of inserting a thing into the sundial when the noun is not gnomon-shaped:
	say "It doesn't seem to fit."

The key and the knife are gnomon-shaped.
After inserting the key into the sundial:
	say "You screw [the key] back into [the sundial]."
After inserting the knife into the sundial:
	say "You jam [the knife] into [the sundial].  Strangely, the direction of its shadow seems to have nothing to do with the position of the sun..."

Understand the command "screw" as something new.
Understand "screw [something] into [something]" and "jam [something] into [something]" as inserting it into.

Instead of inserting something into the sundial when the sundial contains something:
	say "It doesn't seem to fit."

Section - The Man in the Hat

[TO DO: no reason for him to be old now.]
The old man is a man in the garden.  "An old man sits on a bench.  A hat shades his eyes from the sun."

The old man wears a hat.
[TO DO: the hat is "surprising"...?]

[TO DO: gravestone?]

The old man wants the knife.
[TO DO: indicate to the player that he wants the knife]

The player wants the hat.
After reporting giving the knife to the man:
	try the old man giving the hat to the actor.

After reporting the old man giving the hat to the player:
	say "Surprisingly, without his hat, the man doesn't look old at all: his face, though unshaven, is smooth and unwrinkled, and his eyes are sharp and clear.  With a crooked grin, he gives a little salute and wanders off.";
	now the old man is off-stage.

Section - The Bird

Instead of going north from the garden when the hat is not worn:
	say "A bird swoops down from its nest in the eaves of the garden house and attacks your hair!  You wave your arms to shoo it away, but it doesn't go away until you scurry back into the garden."

[TO DO: bird, nest are scenery] 

Chapter - The Garden House

The Garden House is north of the garden.
A desk is a supporter in the garden house.
The drawer is part of the desk.
The drawer is closed and locked.
The key unlocks the drawer.
In the drawer is a book.

The greengrocer wants the book.

After reporting giving the book to the greengrocer:
	say "The greengrocer thanks you and rewards you handsomely.  You return home with the money for your family.";
	end the story finally.
