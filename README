This is an Inform 7 project.  Open the "Last Day of Summer.inform"
directory in the IDE; it will complain about the missing Skein, but
you can ignore that.  You may need to install the following
extensions:

Default Messages by Ron Newcomb
Neutral Library Messages by Aaron Reed

You can download them from: http://inform7.com/write/extensions/

Before releasing, use "Import into Skein..." to import the file
walkthrough.rec, then label its final knot with "***".  This will be
used for "release along with a solution".
